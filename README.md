# Website generator 

### Group 6 - Final project

As users of companies like Wix and Squarespace become more focused on getting their websites up and running, sometimes overpaying for things they don't need, we bring a more streamlined way of getting their product, ideas, and businesses live to the world. 

We have developed a one-stop solution for small businesses looking for a quick way to getting a website up and running. Our website can receive input from the user for vital information like business name, business address, restaurant menus, services, and more. Once the information is obtained, the website will automatically display all the information to the user to upload later.
